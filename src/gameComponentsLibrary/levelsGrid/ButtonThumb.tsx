/**
 * basic square thumbnail using Paper Button component
 *
 * need some styling edits to prevent Paper from truncating the text to 1... on small screens
 * react native Text controls overflow with props "ellipsizeMode" and "numberOfLines" which are props of the main component, not style properties
 * on web this appears as .css-textOneLine
 *
 * want the area which gets color when pressed to be the whole button
 * uses Surface and TouchableRipple
 * TouchableRipple fills a large area but is somehow contained -- by which?
 *
 * BUG: seems like highlight color overflows the sides no matter what
 * only way I got it right was to set labelStyle to a very small, seemingly arbitrary width like 10%
 * seems like it is based on the width of labelStyle but with an added margin
 * such that I can't make labelStyle small enough to get the right highlight while still having it wide enough for the text
